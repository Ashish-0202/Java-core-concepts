**Coupling in Java:**

In object-oriented design, Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another. In other words, how often do changes in class A force-related changes in class B.

Tight Coupling:

It is nothing but dependent on each other or two classes are dependent on each other and if anything is changed in one class it will effect other as well. This behaviour tells that two classes are tightly couples.

Loose Coupling:

In simple words, loose coupling means they are mostly independent. If the only knowledge that class A has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and class B are said to be loosely coupled.
