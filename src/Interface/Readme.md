**Interface**

* An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
* An interface tells what to do but not how to do.
* An interface is kind of contract that is achieved by implementing classes.
* An interface is also a 100% Abstraction.
* All methods in interface are public and abstract by default.
* All the variables declared in interface are constants i.e., public, static & final.
* Since java 8 we can have default and static methods in an interface.
* A class can implement more than one interface by which we can achieve multiple interface.
