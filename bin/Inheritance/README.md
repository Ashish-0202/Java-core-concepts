Here are the key points to understand about inheritance in Java:

Superclass and Subclass: Inheritance involves two types of classes: the superclass (or base class) and the subclass (or derived class). The subclass inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of the superclass.

Syntax: To inherit from a class in Java, you use the extends keyword followed by the name of the superclass. For example:

Access Modifiers: Inherited members (fields and methods) can have different access modifiers in the subclass compared to the superclass:

->If the superclass member is declared as public, it can be accessed by the subclass.
->If the superclass member is declared as protected, it can be accessed by the subclass and by other classes in the same package.
->If the superclass member has default (package-private) access, it can be accessed by the subclass only if they belong to the same package.
->If the superclass member is declared as private, it cannot be accessed by the subclass.
Method Overriding: Subclasses can override superclass methods to provide their own implementation. To override a method, the subclass method must have the same signature (name and parameters) as the superclass method. The @Override annotation is commonly used to indicate that a method is intended to override a superclass method.

Constructor Chaining: Constructors in subclasses can call constructors in the superclass using the super() keyword. This allows initialization of superclass variables before initializing subclass variables.

Single Inheritance: Java supports single inheritance, meaning a class can only inherit from one superclass. However, Java supports multiple levels of inheritance, where a subclass can itself be a superclass for another subclass.

Object Class: Every class in Java is a direct or indirect subclass of the Object class. The Object class provides common methods like toString(), equals(), and hashCode().
